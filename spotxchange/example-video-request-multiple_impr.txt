Video Request for a Multiple Impression with a Private Deal

The following example illustrates a bid request for multiple video impression, possibly for long-form content, with no companion ad slot.  It includes requests for pre, mid and post-roll impressions.  Additionally, the video content itself is described in the "content" object.  A few notes about specific fields in the example:

Bid Request Object
- at: This is a second-price auction.


For all Impression objects:
- sequence: Included and showing the progression of the impression opportunities available.
- linearity: All video impressions are linear.
- protocol: Only VAST 2.0 and 3.0 are allowed.  Note that a wrapper response is not allowed in this example.- - battr: User interactive and alert stype ads (value '13' and '14', respectively) are explicitly being blocked for both the video and its companions.
- pos: Indicates this opportunity is "above the fold".
- api: Indicates that VPAID 1.0 containers are explicitly supported. As such, the mime types supported for VPAID are only "application/x-shockwave-flash" and "application/javascript".  Note that there is an implicit resitrction as to which protocol is allowed in which mimetype.  JavaScript support was not specificed until VPAID 2.0, while Flash supports both VPAID 1.0 and 2.0.
- pos: All video impressions are above the fold.
- maxextended: This is not included meaning no extended video ad duration is allowed.
- playbackmethod: Only auto-play with sound on is allowed.
- delivery: Progressive download is only supported.

For the Pre-Roll Impression Object (id 1):

- bidfloor: Specified per deal.
- startdelay: This is 0 indicating the pre-roll.
- pmp:  This is a private auction restricted to one deal, but that deal is not restricted in seats that can bid.  
    - ext: an exchange-specific deals extension is passed to inform the bidder of the priority assigned deals.
    
For the Mid-Roll Impression Object (id 2):

- bidfloor: Specified per deal.
- startdelay: This is 300 indicating the mid-roll starts 5 minutes into the content.
- pmp:  This is a private auction restricted to two deals, with the second deal restricted to only certain seats.  
    - ext: an exchange-specific deals extension is passed to inform the bidder of the priority assigned deals.
    
For the Post-Roll Impression Object (id 3 ):

- bidfloor: Set at $2.00 CPM.
- startdelay: This is -2 indicating the post-roll.
- pmp:  There are no private marketplace restrictions and all deals and seats are allowed to pariticpate.
